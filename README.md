# DesafioBackend-ITFLEX

# What the company asked for  :green_circle:
The goal of this challenge is to create an aplication that lists, adds, edits and deletes data from DataBase using the requirements below.

## Requirements:shopping_cart:
Python 3
REST API
Save data in a SQLITE DB
README
Deploy into Heroku

## Extra :rocket:
Clean Architecture
SQLAlchemy for DB
SQL-Migrate to build DB

# The project itself :green_circle:
## Technologys used :electron:
Python 3.10 (Backend)<br />
Django 4.0 (Project)<br />
SQLite3 (DataBase)<br />
Heroku (Deploy)<br />

## How to use(step-by-step) :arrow_forward:
1- Clone this repo in your machine.<br />
2- Open it.<br />
3- Cd into the project directory, "ThisIsTheProject", or until you find a folder with the file "manage.py" in the same folder. <br />
4- Run this code to start the application.<br />
```python manage.py runserver```

5- This will make the program run in Localhost.<br />
6- If you wish, deploy it with heroku with any YT tutorial.<br /><br />

## Aditional Info
Note that, some information(like the Port column) from the main table of https://pt.proxyservers.pro/ is JavaScript feeded.
BeautifulSoup cant handle this kind of information feed.
To solve this problem would be necessary run a JavaScript program to collect that data. But by now lets leave it like this.
In resume, if the information of the html is loaded without JavaScript, BeautifulSoup can collect it normally.

# Issues
CSS not working properly, i made the link from settings, django, html and css. But for some reason when i make some changes, its not updating properly. (1)

1- After sometime i found out that my browser's cache was full, so i did Ctrl+F5 to hard refresh and solved the problem. Now Css is working properly
